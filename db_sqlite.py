"""All sqlite3 dependencies.

All sqlite3 dependent code is collected in this module. The rest of the game app will be isolated from direct
interaction with sqlite3. This makes it easy to replace sqlite3 with a different database. Only the code in this
module needs to be adapted for a different database. The rest of the app will work the same.
